## Background

If you have the Mona Lisa's smile cut into 100w pieces, what kind of new gameplay and value discovery?
"Mona Lisa's Smile" was cut into pieces, each with its own separate public key, varying in light, shade, color, color temperature, and transparency, when it contained different asset tokens. GoPixel, the rules of the world implements three problems, one is the uniqueness of the painting, each public key is unique, public key is collection, collection is public key, the owner of the public key can transfer the public key, painting into blank, can also deposit these assets into the public key at any time, painting and restore the original appearance. The second is to solve the problem of the value of collectibles in NFT. MEME, Rarible, OpenSea are ensuring the value of works on its platform with scarcity, but the circulation is poor, and it is difficult to reflect the value in the real sense. But Coco's approach is very interesting, just like the traditional world makes a handicraft out of gold and jade, its value is far higher than the gold and jade of the same quality, and far higher than the same handicraft made of low materials. The third is to create with tokens, brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpening, highlight, shadow, color temperature, tone, fade, text, stickers, special effects, filters and even background can be embodied in the way of tokens, "artists" use these tokens can change any work in the Coco world.
